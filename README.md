# FraudSense: Enhancing Transaction Security with Credit Card Fraud Detection

This project focuses on enhancing transaction security by detecting credit card fraud. Through preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and the implementation of various machine learning models including logistics, decision tree, random forest, gradient boosting, and XGBoost, we aimed to accurately detect fraudulent transactions. The project contributed to achieving an impressive accuracy of 99%.

## Approach:

1. **Preprocessing:** Cleaned and preprocessed the credit card transaction data to handle missing values, normalize features, and prepare the dataset for model training.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Explored the dataset to understand the distribution of fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions, identify important features, and gain insights into the underlying patterns.

3. **Model Implementation:** Implemented logistics, decision tree, random forest, gradient boosting, and XGBoost classifiers to train models on the preprocessed data.

4. **Evaluation:** Evaluated the performance of each model using accuracy metrics. Achieved an outstanding accuracy of 99%.

## Results:

- Logistics: 95%
- Decision Tree: 99%
- Random Forest: 99%
- Gradient Boosting: 99%
- XGBoost: 99%
